# Dad Joke Twilio Voice Bot

This is a simple Twilio Voice Bot.
When someone calls your Twilio number, the bot answers and tells a random dad joke.

## How to run

### 1. Install dependencies

npm install

### 2. Start the server

npm start

(The bot starts on port 3000 by default.)

### 3. Using ngrok for Twilio
